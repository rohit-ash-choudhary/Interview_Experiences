design pattern you used :
The Next greater Element for an element x is the first greater element on the right side of x in the array. Elements for which no greater element exist, consider the next greater element as -1.
Input: arr[] = [ 4 , 5 , 2 , 25 ]
Output:  	 4      –>   5

                 5      –>   25

                 2      –>   25

                25     –>   -1
Explanation: except 25 every element has an element greater than them present on the right side
Input: arr[] = [ 13 , 7, 6 , 12 ]
Output: 	 13      –>    -1

                7       –>     12

                6       –>     12

               12      –>     -1
Explanation: 13 and 12 don’t have any element greater than them present on the right side.

for(int i=0;i<arr.length;i+)
{
    for(int j=i+1;j<arr.length;j++)
{

}
